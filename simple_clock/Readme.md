In this lab, you will create a React application that dynamically displays the current day, date, and time. Each of these elements should be in separate <div> elements with specific IDs. You will use JavaScript's Date object to obtain the current day, date, and time.

## Specific Requirements

###  Display the Current Day:

`Create a <div> with the ID #day.
This div should dynamically display today's day in full text format (e.g., "Monday").`


### Display Today's Date:

`Create a <div> with the ID #date.
This div should show today's date in the format "DD Month YYYY" (e.g., "14 November 2023").`

### Display the Current Time:

`Create a <div> with the ID #time.
This div should dynamically display the current time, updating every second, in the format "HH:MM:SS" (24-hour format).`
## Example Output

#### Your page should display text similar to the following, updating in real-time:

- [x] Day: "Monday
- [x] Date: "November 14, 2023"
- [x] Time: "15:45:30"
